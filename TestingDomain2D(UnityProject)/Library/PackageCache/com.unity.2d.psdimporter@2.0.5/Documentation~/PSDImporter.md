# PSD Importer

## Summary

The __PSD Importer__ is a custom Asset Importer made to import Adobe Photoshop’s PSB files into Unity. The PSB file format is functionally identical to the more common Adobe PSD format, with the additional ability to support much larger images than the PSD format (up to 300,000 by 300,000 pixels in size).

Users saving or converting their PSD working files to the PSB format can import their work with the PSD Importer, and take advantage of the additional functionality and features provided by the importer.

## Supported Functions and Modes

The importer currently supports 2 __Texture Modes__ - [Default](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/TextureTypes.html#Default) and [Sprite](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/TextureTypes.html#Sprite). More Texture Modes will be supported in the future. 

The following Photoshop features are __not__ supported by the PSD Importer __:__ 

* Channels
* Blend Modes
* Layer Opacity
* Effects

You can associate additional Textures to Sprites generated by the PSD Importer, with the Sprite Editor’s [Secondary Textures](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SpriteEditor-SecondaryTextures.html) module. A __Shader__ can then sample these secondary Textures to apply additional effects on the Sprite, such as normal mapping. Refer to Sprite Editor: Secondary Textures](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SpriteEditor-SecondaryTextures.html) for more information.

## Inspector settings

### Texture Type - Default

This is the default __Texture Type__ usage when an image is imported without a specific Texture Type selected. Refer to the documentation on [Texture Types](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/TextureTypes.html) for further information and details.

### Texture Type - Sprite (2D and UI)

![PSD Importer inspect settings](images/PSDImporter_2.0.5_Inspector.png)

When importing a PSB file for character animation with the __2D Animation__ package, set the __Texture Type__ to __Sprite (2D and UI)__.

Property settings that are specific to the __PSD Importer__ are marked by an *.

| Property &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                            | Function                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| __Texture Type__                                             | Select __Sprite (2D and UI)__ to import the Texture as a [Sprite](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Sprites.html). This is required to begin using the imported images with the 2D Animation package. |
| __Sprite Mode__                                              | Use this property to specify how Unity extracts the Sprite graphic from the image. The default option is __Multiple__. |
| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Single                           | Select this option if there is only a single element in the imported image. |
| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Multiple                         | Select this option if there are multiple elements in the imported image. Select this option when importing a character meant for animation with the 2D Animation package. |
| __Pixels Per Unit__                                          | The number of pixels that equal 1 Unity unit.                |
| __Mesh Type__                                                | This defines the __Mesh__ type that is generated for the __Sprite__. This is set to __Tight__ by default. |
| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [Full Rect](https://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/SpriteMeshType.FullRect.html) | The Sprite is mapped onto a mesh generated as a quad.        |
| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [Tight](https://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/SpriteMeshType.Tight.html) | This generates a Mesh based on pixel alpha value of the image, generating a shape that follows the shape of the Sprite. Note that any Sprite that is smaller than 32x32 pixels is generated on a quad Mesh, even if Tight is specified. |
| __Extrude Edges__                                            | Use the slider to determine how much area to leave around the Sprite in the generated Mesh. |
| __Import Hidden__                                            | Enable this property to include hidden layers when importing the PSB. This produces the same import result as unhiding all layers in the source file before importing it into Unity. Clear this option to only import visible layers. |
| __Mosaic__                                                   | This option is only available if Texture Type is set to __Multiple__. Enable this to have Unity generate a Sprite from each imported layer and arrange them into a Sprite Sheet layout. |
| __[Character Rig](#CharRig)__                                | Enable this property to generate a Prefab from the imported source file for a multi-Sprite character. |
| __Use Layer Grouping__                                       | Enable this setting to have Unity generate a Prefab that follows the layer and grouping hierarchy of the imported PSB file. |
| __Pivot__                                                    | Select the pivot point of the Sprite from the dropdown menu options. |
| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Custom                           | Define the X and Y coordinates of a custom __Pivot__ location. |
| __[Reslice](#Reslice)__                                      | Available only when __Mosaic__ is enabled. Select this to clear away any usermade changes to the Sprite previous Sprite metadata and recreate the Sprite from the imported PSB layers. |
| __Experimental__                                             | This feature is experimental and may be changed or removed in the future. It is only available for the following Editor and package versions:<br />- __Unity 2019.2__: 2D PSD Importer version 1.2.0-preview.4 onwards<br />- __Unity 2019.3__: 2D PSD Importer version 2.0.5 onwards |
| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [Keep Duplicate Name](#Duplicate) | Enable this to have Unity generate Sprites from the source files with the exact same name as their source Layers, even when there are multiple Layers with the same exact name. |

## SpriteRect data

The __PSD Importer__ can store 4 possible sets of SpriteRect data, depending on the properties selected when importing an image. 

The 4 sets are created by enabling the following property combinations:

1. Sprite Mode: Single

2. Sprite Mode: Multiple

3. Sprite Mode: Multiple + Mosaic

4. Sprite Mode: Multiple + Mosaic + Character Rig

#### User defined SpriteRect

When the user manually creates a SpriteRect in the Sprite Editor window, the SpriteRect persists even when the Asset has changed. It persists until the user manually deletes the SpriteRect or reimports it with the __Reslice__ option. The position of the SpriteRect does not change even when the size the __Mosaic__ texture changes.

#### Modifying the SpriteRect in the Sprite Editor window

Any modification to a SpriteRect generated from an imported layer will persist and follow wherever the layer is placed in a Mosaic texture, even if it is reimported.

| ![](images/PSDImporter_SpriteRect1.png)                      | ![](images/PSDImporter_SpriteRect2.png)                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| A generated SpriteRect with an imported Layer Sprite that has been modified. | The modified SpriteRect follows where the layer is placed. |

If the name of the generated SpriteRect is changed, the changed name persists and changes to the layer in the source file are not reflected.

If the generated SpriteRect is deleted, it is regenerated when its source layer is reimported, and the source layer both exists and is visible in the source file.

### Effect on SpriteRect when source files are modified

| Modification                                    | Effect                                                       |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **New layer added /Layer visibility turned on** | A new Sprite is automatically generated from the new layer.  |
| **Layer deleted /Layer visibility turned off**  | The Sprite and SpriteRect that was generated from the layer are deleted. |
| **Layer name changed**                          | The changed layer name is copied to the generated SpriteRect, if the SpriteRect's original name has not been modified by the user. |
| **Layer or canvas size changed**                | The SpriteRects size does not change reflect changes made to the layer or canvas size in the source file. regardless if it was modified by the user. To have the SpriteRect reflect the changed size, manually edit the size or select the [Reslice](#Reslice) option. |



## Property Details

### Character Rig<a name="CharRig"></a>

Enable this setting to generate a Prefab containing a Sprite GameObject with the SpriteRenderer component when importing the source file. If the Sprite contains bone and skin data, the __Sprite Skin__ component is added as well. The name of the GameObject is the same as the name specified in its SpriteRect.

### Reslice<a name="Reslice"></a>

When this is selected, all user modification is discarded and SpriteRects are regenerated based on the current source file data. Extra SpriteRect meta data (e.g. Weights, Bones) persist if they remain valid after the SpriteRects are regenerated.

### (Experimental) Keep Duplicate Names<a name="Duplicate"></a>

Enable this feature to have Unity generate Sprites with exactly the same name as their source Layer, even when there are multiple Layers in the source file with the same names. This replaces the default import behavior where Unity appends “_[number]” to each Sprite when generating them from multiple source Layers with the same name.

## Name collision errors

A name collision can occur in the following ways:

1. 2 or more layers in the Asset has the same name. This does not affect Photoshop group name. 

2. A new layer created in the Asset has the same name as a user created SpriteRect.

3. A layer renamed to the same name as user created SpriteRect.

4. A previously hidden layer is imported and has the same name as an existing SpriteRect.

When a name collision occurs, one SpriteRect retains the original name while the rest will be appended with a running number. Which SpriteRect retains their original name is based on the following priority order:

1. A user created SpriteRect.

2. The first layer in the file, starting from the bottom of the stack.

3. Currently existing SpriteRects.
